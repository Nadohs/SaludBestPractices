#What is ¡Salud!?
A game to play with whoever, wherever whereby when someone sneezes and you say "¡Salud!" or any derivation of an exclamation of good will to someone who has just sneezed you gain one point.

#Rules
1. Only sneezes of other people will be counted as a point (you cannot "excuse" yourself to gain a point).
2. If you excuse yourself, that nullifies anyone from excusing you to gain a point.
